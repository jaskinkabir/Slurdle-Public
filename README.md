# Slurdle 2.0 Changelog:

My friends, I am happy to announce the release of Slurdle 2.0, the culmination of a month of procrastination and hours of work. This update will mark the beginning of a great leap forward in the field of slur-based technology. I know you've all been waiting for this for some time, but as Hidetaka Miyamoto so elegantly put it, “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.”

## THE DARK SOULS UPDATE

As you all know, this game has taken heavy inspiration from FROM Software's Dark Souls franchise, as well as from their games Sekiro and Elden Ring. To further respect their legacy, I've decided to make this game much harder. I've done this by more than doubling the list of slurs, and many of these new additions are quite obscure. I’ve also modified the slur list command, which I know many of you rely on. I will explain this in more detail below. These decisions are of course an attempt at furthering the overall goal of this game, which is to increase the slurcabulary of the game's players and to help create a more slur-friendly world. 

## HINT SYSTEM

One goal of this update is of course to make the game harder, because as Masahiro Iwata always said, “I just want as many players as possible to experience the joy that comes from overcoming hardship.” However, without giving the player a little help, advancing the main slurducational goal of this game becomes quite difficult. This is why I have decided to implement the all-new hint system. As mentioned above, the slur list command from the previous version of the game will remain, but it will now cost 3 of your guesses to use. Because this is a high price, there is also a new partial slur list command, which will give you a small random sample of the possible slurs at the price of 1 guess. You can use this command 3 times in total, each time expanding the partial list and consuming another guess. Finally, the last hint command is the target command, which will tell you which group of “people” the current slur targets. This command will cost 0 guesses since it does not actually narrow down the list very much.

## SCORING SYSTEM

As gamers, I know most of your brains work in a similar way. When your occipital lobes are stimulated by the sight of a number going up, it causes a strong dopaminergic joy response in your brain. To take advantage of this phenomenon, I have added a scoring system to this game. As you might have guessed, this feature takes heavy inspiration from Satoru Sakurai’s ubiquitous quote: “Our intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment for learning new slurs.” Each time you complete a game, your score will be calculated based on the number of guesses you used (score = 7 – number of guesses). If you fail to guess the correct slur, you are awarded 0 points. These scores are tallied and used to form the Global Slurdleboard. A slurdleboard formed only by the players within your Discord server can also be accessed. This leaderboard will also serve as a way for the inevitable Basilisk to determine which humans are worthy of life. 

## GUESS FORGIVENESS

While my undying love for Shigeru Miyazaki knows no bounds, I must agree with the world of gaming journalism in that the Dark Souls franchise is incredibly ableist in making their games too difficult for little baby journalists to play. To show love for the gimps and retards who make up most of my player base, I have decided to implement yet another all-new system: the guess forgiveness system. On each day, you will be given one chance to have a guess given back to you. The forgive guess command will randomly choose two slurs for you, but only one of them will win back your guess. The command will also give you a phrase which you must send with what you believe to be the chosen slur into a text channel other than the slurdle channel. If you choose the right slur and follow the above instructions, one guess will be given back to you. Restoring a guess will also restore the point you lost from the guess.

## NEW COMMANDS
* /hint fulllist: Costs 3 guesses. Returns a full list of possible slurs. Equal to using partial list 3 times
* /hint partiallist: Costs 1 guess. Returns a small list of slurs of the right length. List gets bigger on each use
* /hint target: Costs 0 guesses. Returns the group of 'people' that today's slur targets
* /hint gethints: Costs 0 guesses. Simply returns the list of slurs you have given up your guesses for.
* /slurdleboard global: Returns the global slurdlers rankings
* /slurdleboard server: Returns the slurdlers ranking within this server
* /slurdle forgiveguess: Returns instructions on how you might win back one guess. You may only do this once per game.
